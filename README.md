The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) is a public-benefit corporation responsible for public transportation in the state of New York, serving 12 counties in southeastern New York, along with two counties in southwestern Connecticut under contract to the Connecticut Department of Transportation (CDOT). The MTA is the largest transportation network in North America.
Our dataset contains daily ridership data for New Yorkâ€™s Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) from March 2020 to October 2024. It includes total estimated ridership counts and the percentage compared to pre-pandemic levels for different transportation modes. With over 1,700 entries, it offers valuable insights into how COVID-19 affected transit usage and how ridership patterns have changed over time across the MTA network.
